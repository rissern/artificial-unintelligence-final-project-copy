## Overview

This project's goal is to use machine learning in order to analyze areas with settlements and/or electricity using Sentinel 2 and VIIRS satellite images. We employ a Self-Supervised Deep Learning model to semantically segment satellite images. We used SimCLR, which is a self-supervised model used to generate our initial weights for our Deep Learning model, U-Net++. This repo contains scripts to run our code, our various models including various supervised models, test cases, and our best model weights trained on these images.
